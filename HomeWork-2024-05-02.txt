1. Calculate age. Write function that gets a birth year 
    of a person, birth month and birth day,
    gets the current date by the next statements:

        var currDate = new Date();
        var currYear = currDate.getFullYear();
        var currMonth = currDate.getMonth();
        var currDay = currDate.getDate();

   and returns the age of the person. Pay attention that getMonth() 
   returns month number (0 - January, 1 - February, 2 - March, etc.),
   so you may make month input by number too or use some other way.

2. Ternary operator inside ternary operator.

   Example. I'd like to predict the future job of the person and 
            ask him for a color.

   let futureJob = color === 'red' ? 'firefighter' : 
                   color === 'blue' ? 'policeman' : 'web designer';

   a) Ask user to enter a number. Your output should be: "x < 70" 
      or "x > 210" or "x is between 70 and 210".

      CHALLENGE: With more ternary operators inside. Check if 
                 there is any input. Check if the input is numeric.
   
   b) Ask the user to enter his name (one variable) 
      and family name (another variable) and say 
      that you're happy to see him if his name is John Smith, 
      Jane Smith or Jack Daniels, otherwise tell him "go away".

      Check that the user enters not empty string and not null 
      (when clicking on "Cancel")

      (Both, validity check and the content check give you 
      ternary operator inside ternary operator)

5. forEach training 

   const foods = ['pizza','falafel','paSTa','sandwich','saLAd','hummus','soup'];
   const drinks = ['beer','water','coFFEe','tee','milk','juICe','cola'];
   const nums1 = [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 8]
   const nums2 = [1, 3, 7, 0, 2, 5, 3]

   a) Use forEach(), go over the array "drinks" and concatenate all it's elements into one string,
      like this (with a new line and a number): '1. beer
                  2. water
                  3. coffee
                   ....'

      let str = '';
      drinks.forEach((drink,idx) => {
         str += 
      })

      CHALLENGE: use reduce() for this

   b) Create function, avgOfArr(), that gets an array 
       of numbers, calculates the average of each second number
       (check the index for being even)
       (using forEach()) and rounds it to 2 digits after a dot.

      function avgOfArr(ar) {

            let sum = 0;
            ar.forEach((num,ix) => {

            })

            return sum/...
      }

       CHALLENG: use reduce() for this

       HINT: To calculate an average you should divide the sum of numbers
       by their amount - you could divide each number inside the loop,
       while adding it, or divide the whole some after the loop ends.

   c) Go over "foods". If the index is odd, show only 3 first characters of the food, otherwise - the whole food

   d) Go over "foods" and "anti-capitalize" all the foods (2 first letters -lower and other letters -upper).
      Now the array "foods"  should look like: ['piZZA','paSTA','faLAFEL', ...]

   e) Go over "foods" with map() and create new array "order" (הזמנה),
      that will contain the name of food and how many from the array 
      nums1 (you the index to find the appropriate number).
      The new array should look like:
      ['4 pizza', '5 falafel', '6 pasta', '1 sandwich' ... ]

   f) Go over "drinks" with filter() and create new array "summerOrder",
      it should contain amount (from nums1) of food + amount(from nums2)
      of drink but without the pairs that contain hot drinks (no tea
      or coffee).
      The new array should look like:

      ['4 pizza and 1 beer', '5 falafel and 3 water', '2 salad and NO milk' ...]

   g) Go over nums2 with forEach() and change it's numbers:
      if the number is on an even place multiply it by 10,
      if it is not, add to it the appropriate number from nums1.
      Ternary operator!!!

6. Continue with timers.js + font awesome.

   Add a circle div (streetlight) with a standing person inside
   and 3 buttons: "Reset", "Go", "Maintanence".

   Prepare in CSS classes '.red','.yellow','.green'.

   For all the functions use classList interface.

   Button "Reset" should make the "streetlight" red
   and show standing person immediately.

   Button "Go!" should right in the secondDiv: "The button was 
   pressed, wait!" immediately, then, after some short time,
   to make the "streetlight" green and put there a going person,
   and after some longer time to make it red with standing person again.

   Button "Maintanence" should stop the action of "Go!" 
   at any stage and convert the color to yellow and the icon to 
   something appropriate.

7. Number systems.
   There are the examples of using the algorithm at
   from-binary-to-decimal.jpeg and at 
   from-decimal-to-binary.jpeg.
   
   To submit, you could just show the process on the paper
   and make a photo (or, if you prefer, to write it on an HTML page).

   a) Convert 110111 from binary to decimal
   b) Convert 1011001000 from binary to decimal

   c) Convert 302 from decimal to binary
   d) Convert 7821 from decimal to binary
